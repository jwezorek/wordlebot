# wordlebot
cmd line machine player of wordle.

The program guesses words and, currently, a human types in the wordle results of playing the word as a string of '-','y', and 'g' chracters, meaning gray, yellow, and green respectively.

This code is C++17 using range-v3 ranges, as a visual studio solution. If there is interest I can turn into a CMake project and I'd also like to switch it to use C++23 ranges eventually (but currently just putting this here to use GitHub as source control and making it public, because, why not?)
